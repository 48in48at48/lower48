# 48-Week Road Trip Across the Lower 48 States

In 2027, at the age of 48, I will embark on a 48-week road trip through all 48 contiguous US states. This journey will cover every national park and national monument in the lower 48, with a focus on exploring the natural beauty and historic landmarks across the country. Each destination will feature immersive outdoor experiences, including top-rated hikes and activities.
